# Noras-Fantasy

An upcoming RPG game similar to Diablo where a queen will free her land stolen from her father which were invaded by the Mongoloids. The queen will progress through the various levels and free her land from the evil Mongoloid tyranny. 

A short video illustrates the current game progress, currently playing as her father. Please note that these are sandbox levels to test the functionality of the game and the levels along with other aspects of the code will be polished later on.
