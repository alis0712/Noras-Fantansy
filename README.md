# Noras-Fantasy



An upcoming RPG game similar to Diablo where a queen will free her land stolen from her father which were invaded by the Mongoloids. The queen will progress through the various levels and free her land from the evil Mongoloid tyranny. 

A short video illustrates the current game progress, currently playing as her father. Please note that these are sandbox levels to test the functionality of the game and the levels along with other aspects of the code will be polished later on. 


# Unity Version
Initially I was planning to have this game built in Unity, but due to my novice skills in C#, I was not able meet my creative ambiltions and therefore decided to move this project over to Unreal Engine 5

# SDL Version
But before migrating over to Unreal Engine 5, I decided to take an advanced course in Game Programming this past summer, where our professor taught us concepts related to inheritance, polymorphism, the use of lists in creating enemy classes, basics on how to animate frame by frame from images created using Photoshop using an in-house program called frame boy, along with advanced concepts in object oriented programming for use in game programming. All art assets and certain scripts were provided by the professor along with certain code snippets as well. This project was incredibly fun to work on and I hope to further improve my SDL knowledge by making more games using the SDL Libary. These advanced concepts will now allow me to have a more creative vision of what I am hoping out of the game. Please feel to download and play the SDL version of this game use directional keys for movement, Z to slash at an enemy and X to dash from the enemy

# Unreal Engine 5
I am hoping to later start building this game in Unreal Engine 5 sometime during the winter timeframe, once I have built my character models along with environment art assets over the fall.
